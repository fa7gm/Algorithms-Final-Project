##How to download PIL
1. Through Pycharm, go to Files->Settings->Project: Algorithms-Final-Project->Project Interpreter
2. Click on the green + sign to the right
3. In the search box, type in PIL.
4. If you have Python 2.X, click on PIL and install the package. If you have Python 3.x or higher, then click on Pillow-PIL and install the package.
5. You should be ready to use the file.

##Downloading matplotlib, scipy, and numpy 
1. Click on this link and download the package that you need. [matplotlib](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#matplotlib)
2. Copy this file to C:\Python34\Scripts
3. Open cmd.exe on your Windows machine, and cd into /c/Python34/Scripts
4. Type "pip install matplotlib-1.5.0-cp34-noneâ€“win_amd64.whl" (if you downloaded the 64 bit version)

###Note###
<b>This can work with scipy and numpy the same way. The only difference is that while on the website, you can type Ctrl-F, type the package name, and you can have a list of packages you can download. So far, I haven't needed those two, but matplotlib is a must.</b>
